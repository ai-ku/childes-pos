  <comment type="Generic">The child could not be motivated to do the teachng tasks. All 3 tasks were attempted. On the first two (manipulating 2 small figures) he repeatedly asked "Why?" , in other words , why am I doing this. He would not practice the tasks with the exception of stringing beads , the last task. Jarrett had problems stringing the beads and could not , or would not , teach his mother despite coaxing from both the examiner and his mother.</comment>
