Section: Data

	Sessions: child was 2.6 years or younger
	
	Mintz(2003) Dataset:
	aran:	    1a to 20b are used (14a and 14b are missing as in (Clair et al. 2010)). 21a to 34b are omitted.
	nina:	    01 to 23 are ok but 08 is missing. Don't use 24 to 56 part for  replication.
	anne:	    01a to 23b are ok. Don't use the rest 24a to 34b.
	eve:	    01 to 20 are ok.
	naomi:	    01 to 58 are ok. 59 to 93 are omitted.
	peter:	    01 to 12 are ok. 13 to 20 are omitted.
	
	(Clair et al. 2010) uses the CHILDES MOR line to code the
	grammatical categories(%95 accuracy). 
	
	Pre-processes:

	0) Keep only sessions of the child that was 2.6 or younger.
	All utterances from children were exclueded, leaving only
	adulth speech spoken in the presence of child.
	   
	1) Remove and replace all the following things with <utterance
	boundary>.  Thus each of these markings either signalled the
	"END OF A SENTENCE" or a "BREAK" in utterance.

	- all punctuation

	- all pause marking

	- all trailing off

	- all interruption

	* â€ž satallite markers: I replaced them since they used as
          utterance markers according to CHILDES manual.

	* quotation_next_line, vovative and quotations are also marked
          as utterance boundaries.

	?? We should split the combined word forms like I'll or He's
	   since these tokens have more information in them and heart by
	   children.  Easy to split since split point is marked with '~'.
	
	2) Not spoken analysis in MOR line are not included.
	3) Ex: duck [\] duck shows the repetition however MOR LINE
	does not handle the repetition part.  (Clair et al. 2010)
	manually added these line into the data.

	!! Can we add them automatically.
	
	Question:
	
	1) It is not clear how do they handle the start of the
	sentences?  Since without a start sentence tag it is
	impossilbe to assign first words to a frame.
	
	2) (Mintz 2003) frequent frames do not intersect with the
	utterance boundaries however in the case of (Clair et
	al. 2010) this is not clear. In order to handle all data they
	must intersect with uttenrance boundaries.

	- For the (Mintz 2003) replication Clair does not includes the
          frames that cross the utterance boundaries.

Subsection Data::statistics

	-(ver1) The difference between number of types is negligeble.
		Possible reason for this difference is my code always
		uses the correct version of utterances.  The
		difference between the number of tokens might be due
		to the not including the repetitions.  My version
		includes grammatically necessary but not spoken words.

Section: Replicating (Mintz 2003)
	
	1) The most 45 frames of each corpus are extracted (frames do
	not cross utterance boundaries)

	2) CHILDES Copora defines following major POS(pg 108 and 112
	   of http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/CHAT.pdf)

    (Mintz 2003) uses two labelling: 

	   a) Standard 10 labels: Noun+pronouns, verbs+auxlaries+copula,
	   adjectives, prepositions, adverbs, determiner, wh-words,
	   "not", conjunctions, interjection
	   
	   b) Standard 13 labels: (splits noun and verbs) Noun
	   ,pronouns, verbs, auxlaries, copula, adjectives,
	   prepositions, adverbs, determiner, wh-words, "not",
	   conjunctions, interjection
	   
	   - Clair used the standard one and reported that the
             differences were small.

	   - It's not clear how both papers handle communicators such
             as "aha" or others.

	3) Accuracy and completeness are defined in eval.pl.
	   !! completeness is not tested
	   
	4) Random baseline is calculated by assigning the all
	categorised words into the random frames.
	
	5) All multiple t-tests and pairwise comparisons are
	Bonferonni corrected.
	
	6) Each individual corpus is a seperate "subject" in the
	statistical analyses.
